Left to do:
  * Yaml file format requirements
  *    (test file existence, test format if that succeeds)
  * Requirement Sets
  * DSL for creating Requirement Sets easily 
  * Output messages
  * Verbose output messages with instructions for correcting failed deficiencies
  * Output formatting, color
  * Skippable / dependent requirements. (e.g. don't check if redis is running if it's not installed)
  * Rake task for running a dependency set
  * Exit rake without stack trace
  * Env vars or rake flags to trigger different levels of verbosity
